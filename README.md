# DiscourseEmailIncludeAddress

DiscourseEmailIncludeAddress is a plugin for communities that really, really like mailing lists and want to be able to email people when they get a notification rather than replying through Discourse.

It exposes users' email addresses, so I don't recommend it unless your users all expect a level of privacy associated with 1990s era Mailing lists.

## Installation

Follow [Install a Plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157)
how-to from the official Discourse Meta, using `git clone https://github.com/pfaffman/discourse-email-include-address.git`
as the plugin command.

## Usage

Is at your own risk.
